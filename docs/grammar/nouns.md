## Nouns

In Adèkora, nouns are marked for a number of aspects. This section covers how the root words for nouns are inflected (morphologically and with the help of articles) in order to express such aspects.

### Number

Adèkora features a plurality system very similar to English, in which all nouns are either **Singular** (and not marked in any special way) or **Plural** (and marked), to indicate that there is more than one of the thing the noun refers to. Like in English, this distinction occurs by adding a suffix to the word, and this occurs both for nouns *and* pronouns.

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="3">Noun & Pronoun Plurality Suffixes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header"></td>
		<td class="header">Nouns</td>
		<td class="header">Pronouns</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Singular</td>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>∅</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Plural</td>
		<td>-pal</td>
		<td>-lem</td>
	</tr>
</table>

As the table indicates, this plurality marking does not depend on any other aspect of the noun (i.e. Gender, Case, etc.). 

TODO add example.

#### Zero Quantity Plurality

Like in French, the **Singular** number applies when the quantity of the noun is either one *or* zero; rather than *just* one, like in English.

#### Countability

Unlike English, which features Count and [Mass Nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun) (e.g. *water*, because *three waters* is ungrammatical), there is no concept of an uncountable nouns in Adèkora. Therefore, all nouns can gramatically have Singular and Plural numbers, even words like *rice*, *blood*, *wind*, etc.

When talking about nouns whose countability is easily understood (e.g. *box*, *tree*, *sword*, commonly Count Nouns in English), the role of Noun Number is as expected from other languages. For example, the noun *xiroka* (pencil), as expressed in Singular Number, refers to "a pencil/the pencil", while *xirokapal* would mean "pencils/the pencils". 

However, when the noun is not commonly countable (as with liquids, powders, raw materials, abstract concepts, etc.), the Singular Number tends to represent either a (relatively) small quantity, or the concept of the noun itself; the Plural Number is used to express a quantity that is (relatively) large. For example, the noun *chiader* (light), as expressed in Singular Number, would refer to either a small amount of light (e.g. "The lamp's light is pretty"), or to the concept of light itself (e.g. "Light is a bizzare phenomenon"), while *chiaderpal* would refer to a vast amount of light (e.g. "The *'lights'* of the sun cooked the potato").

Since all nouns are countable, cardinal numbers can be used in any noun. Again, when used with commonly countable nouns, these have the expected effect ("One cow", "Two cows", etc.). However, when used with commonly uncountable nouns, the unit of measurement that the cardinal is refering to is greatly dependent on the noun, and is quite relative (counting *water* is likely to use the volume of a small bottle as a unit). 

TODO add example.

### Gender

The [Gender System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender) of Adèkora partitions all nouns into five distinct categories:

* The **Animate** gender (G_AN): people and most animals.
* The **Natural** gender (G_NA): plants, parts of the body, celestial objects, some living beings.
* The **Artificial** gender (G_AR): man-made objects and concepts, tools, clothing, culture.
* The **Abstract** gender (G_AB): intangible ideas, invisible concepts.
* The **Geographical** gender (G_GE): places and their names.


Unlike some languages with gender that make an arbitrary classification, Adèkora's genders attempt to categorize the entire noun space in a methodical manner.

The gender of nouns builds [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(linguistics)) into the grammar, which can help with effective communication. Gender is marked via [**adjective agreement**](./adjectives.md), **[noun articles](./nouns.md#noun-articles)** and noun agreement via [definiteness](nouns.md#definiteness). 

### Definiteness

[Noun Definiteness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness) is marked morphologically by the use a suffix. This marking depends only on the [Gender](nouns.md#gender) of the noun, as specified by this table:

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="6">Noun Definiteness Suffixes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header"></td>
		<td class="header">Animate</td>
		<td class="header">Natural</td>
		<td class="header">Artificial</td>
		<td class="header">Abstract</td>
		<td class="header">Geographical</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

	<tr>
		<td class="header">Indefinite</td>
		<td>-zhu</td>
		<td>-xol</td>
		<td>-ñol</td>
		<td>-zhal</td>
		<td>-mol</td>
	</tr>
</table>

TODO add example.

### Case

The [Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case) of a noun explains its grammatical function inside a sentence. Adèkora features the following five cases:

* **Aboslutive**, used for subjects of intransitive verbs or direct objects (see Ergativity)
* **Ergative**, used for subjects of transitive verbs (see Ergativity)
* **Dative**, used for recipients of an action (i.e. the Indirect Object)
* **Genitive**, used for indicating relation between nouns, commonly possesion
* **Locative**, used indicating that a noun is the place or setting of the action in some way.

#### Marking

Adèkora marks noun case in the [noun article](nouns.md#noun-articles) for nouns, and as a suffix for [pronouns](nouns.md#pronouns). In both cases, the suffix applied corresponds to the following table:

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="5">Case Marking in Noun Articles & Pronouns</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Absolutive</td>
		<td class="header">Ergative</td>
		<td class="header">Dative</td>
		<td class="header">Genitive</td>
		<td class="header">Locative</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>-lo</td>
		<td>-cho</td>
		<td>-chem</td>
		<td>-chek</td>
	</tr>
</table>

#### Ergativity

Unlike English, which uses [Nominative-Accusative Alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative–accusative_alignment), Adèkora features [**Ergative-Absolutive Alignment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative–absolutive_alignment). The main difference is the usage of the two grammatical cases present for Subjects and Direct Objects (which in English would correspond to the distinction between "I" and "me").

In English, the nominative case (e.g. "I") is used for the subject of all verbs, [transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_verb) or [intransitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive_verb). Therefore, we use "I" for both "I saw her" and "I slept". The accusative case (e.g. "me") is reserved only for direct objects of transitive verbs (e.g. "He loved me" instead of "He loved I").

However, Adèkora uses the **Absolutive** case (what "would be" the nominative) for the **subject of intransitive verbs** and **direct objects**, whereas the **Ergative** case is used *only* for **subjects of transitive verbs**. 

TODO add example.

#### Dative Case

The **Dative Case** acts very similarly to [that of German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative_case#German). This case is used to mark the indirect object of a sentence; that is, the noun that receives (in some way) the direct object.

TODO add example.

#### Genitive Case

The **Genitive Case** is used to mark that a noun is in some way a possesor of the clause immediately before. This is very similar to the [English Saxon Genitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case#English) (the " 's " ending) used nowadays, but with reversed order. 

TODO add example.

#### Locative Case

The [**Locative Case**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case) is used to mark that a noun acts as a location for the sentence's action; this corresponds vaguely to the usage of English prepositions such as "in", "on", "at", etc. 

TODO add example.

### Proximals

Proximals are an optional level of marking that can be applied to both nouns and pronouns to emphasize the proximity of the noun to the speaker or listener. The effect is very similar to what can be achieved by using adjectives like *close*, *far* in English, but instead ingrained in noun grammar. 

The three levels of proximity correspond to those used in [Localizers](../writing/localizers.md#localizers), and are marked with a prefix for both [noun articles](nouns.md#noun-articles) and [pronouns](nouns.md#pronouns) as follows:

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="4">Proximal Marking in Noun Articles & Pronouns</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Unmarked</td>
		<td class="header">Close</td>
		<td class="header">Near Far</td>
		<td class="header">Remote Far</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>ke-</td>
		<td>zhi-</td>
		<td>ake-</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Noun Declensions

Adèkora morphologically declines Nouns (that are neither [Pronouns](nouns.md#pronouns) nor [Localizers](../writing/localizers.md)) in order to mark for [Definiteness](nouns.md#definiteness) and [Plurality](nouns.md#countability); all other aspects are taken care of by the use of a [Noun Article](#noun-articles).

The declensions of Nouns have the following structure:

<div class="center showcase">
	<span> {NOUN}-{DEFINITENESS}-{PLURALITY} </span>
</div>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="6">Noun Definiteness Suffixes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header"></td>
		<td class="header">Animate</td>
		<td class="header">Natural</td>
		<td class="header">Artificial</td>
		<td class="header">Abstract</td>
		<td class="header">Geographical</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Definite</td>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>∅</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Indefinite</td>
		<td>-zhu</td>
		<td>-xol</td>
		<td>-ñol</td>
		<td>-zhal</td>
		<td>-mol</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="3">Noun Plurality Suffixes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Singular</td>
		<td>∅</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Plural</td>
		<td>-pal</td>
	</tr>
</table>

TODO add example.

### Noun Articles

For nouns that are neither [Pronouns](nouns.md#pronouns) nor [Localizers](../writing/localizers.md), a mandatory article that comes before the noun is required. This article marks the noun in both [Gender](nouns.md#gender) and [Case](nouns.md#case). There is also an optional [Proximal](nouns.md#proximals) prefix.

Noun articles have the following structure, marked as specified in the following paragraphs:

<div class="center showcase">
	<span> {PROXIMAL}-{GENDER}-{CASE} </span>
</div>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="4">Proximal Marking in Noun Articles</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Unnmarked</td>
		<td class="header">Close</td>
		<td class="header">Near Far</td>
		<td class="header">Remote Far</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>ke-</td>
		<td>zhi-</td>
		<td>ake-</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="5">Gender Marking in Noun Articles</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Animate</td>
		<td class="header">Natural</td>
		<td class="header">Artificial</td>
		<td class="header">Abstract</td>
		<td class="header">Geographical</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-dei-</td>
		<td>-du-</td>
		<td>-dem-</td>
		<td>-dar-</td>
		<td>-mi-</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="5">Case Marking in Noun Articles</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Absolutive</td>
		<td class="header">Ergative</td>
		<td class="header">Dative</td>
		<td class="header">Genitive</td>
		<td class="header">Locative</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>-lo</td>
		<td>-cho</td>
		<td>-chem</td>
		<td>-chek</td>
	</tr>
</table>

This configuration allows 100 possible articles. However, given the agglutinative regularity of the affixes, the memorization required is much less than would be needed if there was no connection between the components.

TODO add example.

### Pronouns

The Pronouns of Adèkora mark for [Person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person), [Number](nouns.md#number), [Gender](nouns.md#gender), [Case](nouns.md#gender), [Definiteness](nouns.md#definiteness) and optionally [Proximality](nouns.md#proximals). As opposed to nouns, pronouns do not carry a [noun article](nouns.md#noun-articles), and present the following structure:

<div class="center showcase">
	<span> {PROXIMAL}-{ROOT}-{PLURALITY}-{CASE} </span>
</div>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="4">Proximal Marking in Pronouns</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Unmarked</td>
		<td class="header">Close</td>
		<td class="header">Near Far</td>
		<td class="header">Remote Far</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>ke-</td>
		<td>zhi-</td>
		<td>ake-</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="7">List of Pronoun Roots</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header left"></td>
		<td class="header">1° person</td>
		<td class="header">2° person</td>
		<td class="header">3° person</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header left">Animate (formal)</td>
		<td>ixei</td>
		<td>zhiex</td>
		<td>zhàxe</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header left">Animate (informal)</td>
		<td>ikei</td>
		<td>zhiek</td>
		<td>zhàke</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header left">Natural</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>uxem</td>
		<td>uxà</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header left">Artificial</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>ñiem</td>
		<td>ñà</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header left">Abstract</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>zharem</td>
		<td>zhà</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header left">Geographical</td>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>midem</td>
		<td>midà</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="3">Pronoun Plurality Suffixes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Singular</td>
		<td>∅</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Plural</td>
		<td>-lem</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<table class="common-table">
	<tr>
		<td class="header" colspan="5">Case Marking in Pronouns</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="header">Absolutive</td>
		<td class="header">Ergative</td>
		<td class="header">Dative</td>
		<td class="header">Genitive</td>
		<td class="header">Locative</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>∅</td>
		<td>-lo</td>
		<td>-cho</td>
		<td>-chem</td>
		<td>-chek</td>
	</tr>
</table>


In this structure, the Pronoun Root specifies the gender and number of the pronoun. Note that there is formality marking exclusively for the animate gender, and that first person pronouns are only defined for the animate gender. Adèkora does not feature [clusivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clusivity), and so the first person plural pronoun is ambiguous, as it can be exclusive or inclusive depending on context.
