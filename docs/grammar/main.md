# Adèkora Grammar

This section provides a basic description of the Grammar of Adèkora, covering Morphology (the formation of words) and Syntax (the formation of sentences). The topics are ordered with the intention of putting the simpler and more neccesary concepts first, and then going into finer details. More examples and exceptions are listed in the respective sub-pages. Examples are written using the [romanization system](../phonology/main.md#romanization).


## Word Order

Adèkora follows [SVO Word Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order), which means that sentences usually have the Subject, then the Verb and lastly the Objejct. This is the same as English, so a sentence such as *"The cat follows her"* would have the words for *cat* (<*kolexa*>), *follow* (<*plau*>) and *her* (<*ilzhàxelem*>) in that same order.


## Agglutinativity

As an [**agglutinative language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language), Adèkora uses many **affixes to mark for aspects of grammar** such as person, number, evidentiality, completion of an action, etc. This affixes are also used to derive complex words from simpler roots.
