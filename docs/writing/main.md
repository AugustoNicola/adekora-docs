# Adèkora Writing System

Adèkora's main writing system (called TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM) is an alphabet-based system with heavy use of ligadures. Each phoneme has its own character (which are called TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_CHARACTER) according to the list below.

The TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_CHARACTER are combined into syllables (called TODO_WRITING_SYLLABLE). All the TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_CHARACTER in a syllable are connected by the TODO_WRITING_LINE, a continuous line at the bottom of the characters.

The TODO_WRITING_SYLLABLE of a word are strung together using a special mark called TODO_WRITING_SEPARATOR, a curved dash at the upper part of the line.

## Phonotactics

### Syllable Structure

Adèkora's syllables follow the syllabic pattern **[ (C)(C)(C) ][ V ][ (C) ]**, with the onset, nucleus and coda delimitated by brackets. This means that all syllables have:

* From zero to three consonants as the **onset**
* Exactly one vowel (in the form of a monophthong or diphthong) as the **nucleus**
* Zero or one consonant as the **coda**

### Syllable Clustering

#### Onset Clustering
* When the onset has a single consonant, all 14 consonants can be used.
* When the onset has two consonants, only the following combinations are allowed:
<div style="margin-left:50px;">
 <x>pn</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pr</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pl</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>bŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>br</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>bzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dr</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dz</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kn</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kr</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kz</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>ŕl</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zl</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zp</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zb</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zd</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zch</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zm</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zn</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zñ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zhm</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zhn</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zhñ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span>
</div>
* When the onset has three consonants, only the following combinations are allowed: 

<div style="margin-left:50px;">
 <x>pŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>bŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> 
</div>


#### Nucleus Clustering
Any single one of the 13 vowels (counting monophthongs and diphthongs) can be used as the nucleus.

#### Coda Clustering

Any single one of the 14 consonants can be used as the coda. However, if nucleus ends with a closed monophthong (any of <x>i</x>, <x>u</x>, <x>à</x>, <x>è</x>), then the coda must be empty.
