## Adèkora Font

This documentation site uses an OpenType font capable of representing Adèkora's glyphs. Since each glyph represents only one phoneme, the font allows to type in the [romanization](../phonology/main.md#romanization) of Adèkora and the corresponding glyphs will be displayed.

Every glyph representing a phoneme that uses only one latin character can be typed using that character. The glyphs whose phoneme has two latin characters (< **rr** >, < **ch** >, < **zh**> ) can be written using a ligature of the two characters (e.g. writing < **ch** > will produce the appropiate glyph < **<wm>ch</wm>** >), or alternatively by using the uppercase version of its first letter (e.g. writing < **C** > will also produce the same glyph).

The punctuation marks have their designated characters: the syllable delimiter is the single-quote < **'** >, the word delimiter is the common whitespace (such as when pressing spacebar), and the sentence delimiter is the standard period < **.** >. This gives the typing in the font a feeling similar to English and many common languages, since the proccess of separating words and sentences is the same.

Localizers are mapped to common symbols: *kemàlizal* is < **!** >, *zhimàlizal* is < **"** >, *akemàlizal* is < **#** >, *zhikozal* is < **$** >, *umizal* is < **%** >, and *unokizal* is < **&** >.

The digits from *zero* to *seven* are mapped to their corresponding standard digit in base-10.

As an extra feature, a clean whitespace can be inserted using the slash symbol < **/** >.

All other common latin characters that are not used are mapped to a question mark as a glyph-not-found symbol.
