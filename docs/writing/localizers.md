## Localizers

In Adèkora, a few spatial concepts are given their own glyph, called **Localizers**:

- *kemàlizal* < <wl>!</wl> >, a distance close to the speaker.
- *zhimàlizal* < <wl>"</wl> >, an area far from the speaker such that vision is still mantained.
- *akemàlizal*, < <wl>#</wl> >, an area far from the speaker such that there is no vision of the place.
- *zhikozal* < <wl>$</wl> >, Life (commonly to convey that something/someone is alive).
- *umizal* < <wl>%</wl> >, Death (commonly to convey that something/someone is dead).
- *unokizal* < <wl>&</wl> >, the Unknown (commonly to convey that something/someone is missing).

All localizers are syntactically treated as places. As an example, to convey that someone is alive, the usage of *TODO_LIFE* would more acurrately be translated as to *"be in the Life"*.
