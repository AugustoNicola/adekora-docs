## Punctuation


### Punctuation Marks
Aside from standard characters, Adèkora has punctuation marks for the following purposes:

- *sukañela*, to separate syllables (from the same word), with < <wl>'</wl> >.
- *sukañikal*, to separate words, with < <wl>&hairsp; &hairsp;</wl> >.
- *sukumela*, to end sentences, with < <wl>.</wl> >.

As an example, consider the following text:

<wl>a'dè'ko'ra zhe xal'ku.ñe'xu'lox ki'che</wl>

The extract has two sentences. The first sentence has three words, which have four, one and two syllables respectively. The second sentence has two words, with three and two syllables respectively.

### Style

Adèkora's writing system provides a glyph-dense representation with narrow spaces. Unlike most roman-based writing systems, sentences are not separated by some whitespace. In Adèkora, only the *sukumela* is necessary to separate sentences.

Paragraphs are separated by a newline; indentation when starting a new paragraph is not common.

### Missing Common Punctuation Marks

Some punctuation marks common in other languages (such as commas, exclamation/quotation marks, parenthesis) are not present. Instead, sentences indicate interrogative and other clauses by other means, and sentence structure is simplified to avoid using commas.
