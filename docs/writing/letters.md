## Letters

Each letter represents exactly one [phoneme](../phonology/main.md#adèkora-phonology), so there is only one pronounciation for each one. Adèkora's letters are strung to form syllables according to the [phonotactical rules](../phonology/main.md#phonotactics).

### The TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_LINE
The bottom line that appears in many characters is called *TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_LINE*, and it physically connects the letters to create the syllables. Therefore, all consonants start and end such that they can be indefinetly concatenated using the *TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_LINE*, since consonants can potentially have more letters before or after them. Only some vowels follow this principle, whereas the so-called *determinate vowels* do not continue the *TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_LINE*, indicating that the syllable must end there. In that sense, the *TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_LINE* acts as a guide of valid syllables.

For example, < <wm>è</wm> > ( /**è**/ ) is considered a *determinate vowel*, and so letters can only appear before it in its syllable, such as in < <wm>dè</wm> > ( /**dè**/). In contrast, < <wm>o</wm> > ( /**o**/ ) is not a *determinate vowel*, and so a syllable such as < <wm>kox</wm> > ( /**kox**/ ) is valid.
