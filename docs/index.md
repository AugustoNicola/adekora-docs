# Adèkora Conlang Documentation

Welcome! This is the main page for the documentation of the constructed language Adèkora by Augusto Nicola. In this Wiki I aim to elaborate the basic specification of the conlang in the more useful way possible.

## Basic Description

TODO

## Motivation and Scope

The main goal of this conlang is to try for the first time to construct a fictional language from the ground up. I do not aim to build a solid conlang with this attempt, just to learn the basic process requiered to make one.

### Target Audience

Since the objective of the conlang is to learn, the main audience of Adèkora is me! (Or *yourself* if you are reading this). I believe this conlang should satisfy my personal aesthetics first and foremost, and *then* try to achieve a structure decent enough to share.

### Main Objectives

What properties I want Adèkora to have:

- **Complete**; satisfies the minimum level of development required in conlang development (phonology, grammar, etc.).
- **Easily computable**; that is, its rules are regular enough so that I could create computer-based functionality such as parsing or translation.
- **Semi-formally defined**; all areas of the language are described in a comprehensible manner that conlangers understand as the standard.
- **Pretty**; it should follow my personal aesthetics regarding language, specially in writing and phonology.
- **Innovative**; there should be features of languages that I as a speaker of Spanish and English am not familiar with
- **Fairly Useful**; communicating with Adèkora should not be much more difficult than other languages, provided that some level of mastery is achieved.
- **Basic Lexicon**; a decent chunk of words should be defined in Adèkora's vocabulary.
