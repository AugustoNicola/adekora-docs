### Syllable Structure

Adèkora's syllables follow the [syllabic pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable#Components) **[ (C)(C)(C) ][ V ][ (C) ]**, with the onset, nucleus and coda delimitated by brackets. This means that all syllables have:

* From zero to three consonants as the **onset**
* Exactly one vowel (in the form of a monophthong or diphthong) as the **nucleus**
* Zero or one consonant as the **coda**

### Syllable Clustering

#### Onset Clustering
* When the onset has a single consonant, all 14 consonants can be used.
* When the onset has two consonants, only the following combinations are allowed:
<div style="margin-left:50px;">
 <x>pn</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pr</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>pl</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>bŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>br</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>bzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dr</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dz</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kn</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kŕ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kr</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kz</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zhm</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zhn</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>zhñ</x> <span>&nbsp;</span>
</div>
* When the onset has three consonants, only the following combinations are allowed: 

<div style="margin-left:50px;">
 <x>pŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>bŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>dŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> <x>kŕzh</x> <span>&nbsp;</span> 
</div>

If the coda of the previous syllable is <x>zh</x> and the onset of the next syllable also starts with <x>zh</x> (as in <x>zhm</x>, <x>zhn</x> or <x>zhñ</x>), gemination is used as discussed in [Consonant Repetition](phonotactics.md#consonant-repetition). (For example, *xazh-zhme-ra* is adjusted to *xazh-me-ra* /*xaʒːme.ɾa*/).


#### Nucleus Clustering
Any single one of the 13 vowels (counting monophthongs and diphthongs) can be used as the nucleus.

#### Coda Clustering

Any single one of the 14 consonants can be used as the coda. However, certain rules apply:

- If the nucleus ends with a *closed* monophthong (i.e. <x>i</x>, <x>u</x>, <x>à</x>, <x>è</x>), then the coda *must* be empty. (For example, *dè* is valid, whereas *dèm* is not.)
- Plosives (i.e. <x>p</x>, <x>b</x>, <x>d</x>, <x>ch</x>, <x>k</x>) can *only* appear in codas of the last syllables of words. (For example, *kap* and *lamkap* are both valid, while *lapkap* is invalid.)

### Consonant Repetition

In general, if the same phoneme appears next to itself as both a coda and an onset, it is [geminated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination) such that a single geminated sound remains, acting as an [ambisyllabic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ambisyllabicity#:~:text=ambisyllabicity%20(uncountable),upper"%20or%20"button".) phoneme. For example, *kil-leñ* would be converted to *kileñ* (*/kilːeɲ/*), which can be separated into syllables as both *kil-eñ* and *ki-leñ* (though the former is more commonly used).

The gemination is also used to cover cases where <x>ŕ</x> and <x>r</x> appear next to each other. In such situations, a geminated <x>ŕ</x> remains. For example, *kar-ŕox* would convert to *kaŕox*.

### Syllable Separation

Syllable separation is not used to convey semantical difference. For example, there can only be **one** word that is pronounced as *kaxan*, and it may be separated into syllables as *kax-an* or *ka-xan*. Alhtough the default is for the shared consonant to fall in the onset (like in *ka-xan*), the rules of syllable separation can have exceptions (especially when applying many affixes to the same word), which is why the separation is explicited using notation.

Since Adèkora's [writing system](../writing/main.md) defines that syllables are explicitly delimited using a special character, this distintcion is made clear when writing the word (for *kaxan*, both possibilities are written <ws>kax'an</ws> and <ws>ka'xan</ws>, respectivelly).
