## Phonetic Allophony

Adèkora is very permissive regarding its [allophonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone) aspect. This means that, for every single **phoneme** of Adèkora (i.e. the symbols from [the Main Chart](main.md)), many **phones** (i.e. actual sounds, as specifically characterized using the IPA) are representing said phonemes.

The most simple case is regarding [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant): like in English, both phones [b] and [bʰ] are considered a realization of the phoneme /b/. This idea applies to many other phonemes regarding possible variations of their respective phones.

### Aspiration

As discussed, both aspirated and unaspirated variants of all present obstruents (<x>p</x>, <x>b</x>, <x>d</x>, <x>k</x>) and fricatives (<x>z</x>, <x>zh</x>, <x>x</x>) are treated allophonically.

### Vowels

Since the seven monophthongs of Adèkora are very discernible, small variations in the centralization and openness of vowels are treated as allophones. (For example, all of [e], [e̞] and [ë] are allohponic variations of the phoneme /e̞/.)
