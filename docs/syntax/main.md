# Adèkora Syntax

This section provides a description of the [Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) of Adèkora, the section of Grammar focused on the formation of sentences by combining [words](../morphology/main.md). The topics are ordered with the intention of putting the simpler and more neccesary concepts first, and then going into finer details. More examples and exceptions are listed in the respective sub-pages. Examples are written using the [romanization system](../phonology/main.md#romanization).

## Word Order

Adèkora follows [SVO Word Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order), which means that sentences usually have the Subject, then the Verb and lastly the Objejct. This is the same as English, so a sentence such as *"The cat follows her"* would have the words for *cat* (<*kolexa*>), *follow* (<*plau*>) and *her* (<*ilzhàxelem*>) in that same order.


## Head-Directionality

Adèkora is a strongly **head-initial** language. This means that in many types of phrases, the most important component - the head - is usually placed at the start. This applies to the following structures:

- **Noun-Adjective order**: in noun phrases where [adjectives](../morphology/main.md#adjectives) affect a [noun](../morphology/nouns.md), the noun is placed first and the adjectives follow.
- **Verb-Adverb order**: in verb phrases where [adverbs](../morphology/main.md#adverbs) affect a [verb](../morphology/verbs.md), the verb is placed first and the adverbs follow.
- **Adjective-Adverb order**: in cases where an adverb is modifying an adjective, the adjective is placed first with any modifiers following afterwards.
- **Noun-Genitive order**: [genitive clauses](../morphology/nouns.md#genitive-case) - those that express possesion - place the noun first and the genitive afterwards.
- **Preposition-Noun order**: Adèkora mainly uses adpositions that come before clauses - especially noun phrases - to convey various aspects such as relative position, temporal relation, etc.
- **Noun-Relative Clause order**: noun phrases that use relative clauses to further describe the subject typically place the noun first and the relative clause afterwards.

## Negation

Negation is expressed by the use of the **two negation particles *lau* and *kun***. The particle *lau* is placed just before the start of the clause being negated (usually a verb phrase), while *kun* is located at the end of the clause. This effectively encapsulates the clause. 

TODO add example "I do not like cats" => "I LAU like cats KUN"

For common phrases in which there is no ambiguity of the clause that is negated, the particle before the clause can be omitted, and the particle placed at the end can be either one of the two particles. This is common in informal speech.

TODO add example "I do not see her" => "I see her KUN"
                 "I am not sleeping" => "I sleeping KUN" or "I sleeping LAU"

The usage of both particles is especially useful in sentences where there are multiple elements being negated, in order to disambiguate.

TODO add example "I like someone that dances" => "I like someone that dances"
                 "I do not like someone that dances" => "I LAU like someone that dances KUN"
				 "I like someone that does not dance" => "I like someone that LAU dances KUN"
				 "I do not like someone that does not dance" => "I LAU like someone that dances LAU KUN"
