The topics are ordered with the intention of putting the simpler and more neccesary concepts first, and then going into finer details. More examples and exceptions are listed in the respective sub-pages. Examples are written using the romanization system . Agglutinativity \u00b6 As a highly agglutinative language , Ad\u00e8kora uses many affixes , mainly for two purposes: to mark for aspects of grammar , and to generate words . Many word classes such as nouns, verbs and adjectives use affixes to mark for aspects like person, number, gender, tense, aspect, etc. This affix rules are explored in their respective word class sections. Since Ad\u00e8kora is agglutinative, it is common for each affix to have one precise simple meaning , and this entails the concatenation of many affixes to express all required aspects of grammar in words. On the other hand, affixes can be combined to create long sequences of affix transformations in order to create words with precise meaning , as explained in the Word Derivation Section . Nouns \u00b6 The formation of nouns in Ad\u00e8kora requires the expression of the noun's aspects (such as person and number ) via morphological declension and with the use of a mandatory article . All nouns fall into one of five possible genders , which partition the noun space in a defined manner. A case system is also used, based on the Ergative-Absolutive alignment with some other extra cases. Definiteness (i.e. the vs. a/an ) is also marked morphologically. Finally, there is some extra marking for expressing the proximity of the noun to the speaker/listener. The structure of noun declension and pronouns is illustrated below. {PROXIMAL}-{GENDER}-{CASE} NOUN-{DEFINITENESS}-{PLURALITY} {PROXIMAL}-ROOT-{PLURALITY}-{CASE} Verbs \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora's verbs mark TMA (Tense-Mood-Aspect) using affixes in the verb's conjugation, with optional morphological marking for source of evidence . There are three tenses, four aspects, and four moods. Verbs agree with their subjects in gender via tense marking. Some valency-changing particles are also present. The structure of verb conjugation is shown below. {MOOD}-{VERB}-{TENSE}-{ASPECT}-{EVIDENTIALITY} Adjectives \u00b6 Location and Agreement \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora's adjectives are placed after the noun phrases they describe, and display agreement with them in Gender when the noun phrase is plural , according to the following table. Adjective-Noun Agreement Suffixes Animate Natural Artificial Abstract Geographical Singular \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 Plural -zhei -xem -\u00f1em -zham -mei TODO add example. General Order \u00b6 When many adjectives are applied to the same noun phrase, they are placed from left to right according to this ordering. NOUN PHRASE > Origin > Opinion > Color > Shape > Size > Other TODO add example. Comparatives and Superlatives \u00b6 The comparative and superlative versions of adjectives are formed by adding a prefix. The comparative prefix bax- works very similarly to the -er suffix of English, while the superlative prefix \u0155ax- is similar to the -est English suffix. TODO add example. Adjectives in the comparative or superlative form can also be transformed into nouns using the noun-converter prefix chi-, in order to express concepts such as I am the biggest (TODO add example.) Adverbs \u00b6 Adverbs in Ad\u00e8kora are placed after the structure they modify , be it a verb, adjective, or something else; they do not morphologically agree with any other type of word, unlike adjectives. In case multiple adverbs are affecting the same clause or affecting one another, the principle of head-directionality is followed, and therefore the adverbs are applied from right to left. TODO add examples. Pronouns \u00b6 Aside for the Personal Pronouns specified in the Nouns section , Ad\u00e8kora manages the other types of pronouns in particular ways. Via Case \u00b6 Some types are managed by case marking : the Possesive pronouns ( hers, yours, mine ) are covered by the Genitive case ; the Reflexive pronouns (like in I did it for myself ) use the Absolutive case ; the Reciprocal pronouns (as in They liked each other ) are deduced from context using the Absolutive case. Demonstrative \u00b6 The Demonstrative pronouns ( that in Look at that pencil! ) are expressed using the Personal pronouns with proximal marking before the noun phrase (if there is one). In case there is a noun phrase, the Personal pronoun's gender must agree with that of the noun phrase; if there is not, the gender must be Abstract. TODO add examples \"She looks at this pencil\" => \"She look 3S-G_AR-close pencil\" \"I look at that leaf (which I can see)\" => \"I look 3S-G_NA-nearfar leaf\" \"He looks at that (which He can not see)\" => \"He look 3S-G_AB-remfar\" Interrogative \u00b6 The Interrogative pronouns ( what , how , who , why , etc.) are used when asking questions , and have their own words. TODO add words. Relative \u00b6 The Relative pronouns are used to mark relative clauses which are related to an interrogative pronoun . Instead of being the same word as their interrogative counterpart - like in English - the suffix -kep to transform any Interrogative pronoun into a Relative one . TODO add example. Indefinite \u00b6 The role of Indefinite pronouns (like somebody , anything , no one ) is covered in Ad\u00e8kora by dedicated words exhibiting a regular affix pattern. TODO add words. Word Derivation \u00b6 Since Ad\u00e8kora heavily relies on affixes to morphologically mark many aspects across all word types, an extensive system of prefixes and suffixes is present that greatly helps obtain new words by concatenating affixes. Although there are many root words, with original morphology and many examples of other derivational strategies (such as compounding ), this is the most common process. Ad\u00e8kora uses this affix system to create both inflections and derivations; that is, some affixes transform a word from one class into another word from the same class, whereas other affixes create words from a different grammatical class than the original (moreover, there exist affixes that have the precise intention of adapting a concept into a particular word class, such as the noun-generator prefix chi- ). The many affixes of Ad\u00e8kora are documented in the Vocabulary Section , with information on the type of affix, particular considerations, etc.","title":"Main Page"},{"location":"morphology/main/#adekora-morphology","text":"This section provides a basic description of the Morphology of Ad\u00e8kora, the section of Grammar focused on morphemes and their combinations that form words .

This section covers how the root words for nouns are inflected (morphologically and with the help of articles) in order to express such aspects. Number \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora features a plurality system very similar to English, in which all nouns are either Singular (and not marked in any special way) or Plural (and marked), to indicate that there is more than one of the thing the noun refers to. Like in English, this distinction occurs by adding a suffix to the word, and this occurs both for nouns and pronouns. Noun & Pronoun Plurality Suffixes Nouns Pronouns Singular \u2205 \u2205 Plural -pal -lem As the table indicates, this plurality marking does not depend on any other aspect of the noun (i.e. Gender, Case, etc.). TODO add example. Zero Quantity Plurality \u00b6 Like in French, the Singular number applies when the quantity of the noun is either one or zero; rather than just one, like in English. Countability \u00b6 Unlike English, which features Count and Mass Nouns (e.g. water , because three waters is ungrammatical), there is no concept of an uncountable nouns in Ad\u00e8kora. Therefore, all nouns can gramatically have Singular and Plural numbers, even words like rice , blood , wind , etc. When talking about nouns whose countability is easily understood (e.g. box , tree , sword , commonly Count Nouns in English), the role of Noun Number is as expected from other languages. For example, the noun xiroka (pencil), as expressed in Singular Number, refers to \"a pencil/the pencil\", while xirokapal would mean \"pencils/the pencils\". However, when the noun is not commonly countable (as with liquids, powders, raw materials, abstract concepts, etc.), the Singular Number tends to represent either a (relatively) small quantity, or the concept of the noun itself; the Plural Number is used to express a quantity that is (relatively) large. For example, the noun chiader (light), as expressed in Singular Number, would refer to either a small amount of light (e.g. \"The lamp's light is pretty\"), or to the concept of light itself (e.g. \"Light is a bizzare phenomenon\"), while chiaderpal would refer to a vast amount of light (e.g. \"The 'lights' of the sun cooked the potato\"). Since all nouns are countable, cardinal numbers can be used in any noun. Again, when used with commonly countable nouns, these have the expected effect (\"One cow\", \"Two cows\", etc.). However, when used with commonly uncountable nouns, the unit of measurement that the cardinal is refering to is greatly dependent on the noun, and is quite relative (counting water is likely to use the volume of a small bottle as a unit). TODO add example. Gender \u00b6 The Gender System of Ad\u00e8kora partitions all nouns into five distinct categories: The Animate gender (G_AN): people and most animals. The Natural gender (G_NA): plants, parts of the body, celestial objects, some living beings. The Artificial gender (G_AR): man-made objects and concepts, tools, clothing, culture. The Abstract gender (G_AB): intangible ideas, invisible concepts. The Geographical gender (G_GE): places and their names. Unlike some languages with gender that make an arbitrary classification, Ad\u00e8kora's genders attempt to categorize the entire noun space in a methodical manner. The gender of nouns builds redundancy into the grammar, which can help with effective communication. Gender is marked via adjective agreement , noun articles and noun agreement via definiteness . Definiteness \u00b6 Noun Definiteness is marked morphologically by the use a suffix. This marking depends only on the Gender of the noun, as specified by this table: Noun Definiteness Suffixes Animate Natural Artificial Abstract Geographical Definite \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 Indefinite -zhu -xol -\u00f1ol -zhal -mol TODO add example. Case \u00b6 The Case of a noun explains its grammatical function inside a sentence. Ad\u00e8kora features the following five cases: Aboslutive , used for subjects of intransitive verbs or direct objects (see Ergativity) Ergative , used for subjects of transitive verbs (see Ergativity) Dative , used for recipients of an action (i.e. the Indirect Object) Genitive , used for indicating relation between nouns, commonly possesion Locative , used indicating that a noun is the place or setting of the action in some way. Marking \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora marks noun case in the noun article for nouns, and as a suffix for pronouns . In both cases, the suffix applied corresponds to the following table: Case Marking in Noun Articles & Pronouns Absolutive Ergative Dative Genitive Locative \u2205 -lo -cho -chem -chek Ergativity \u00b6 Unlike English, which uses Nominative-Accusative Alignment , Ad\u00e8kora features Ergative-Absolutive Alignment . The main difference is the usage of the two grammatical cases present for Subjects and Direct Objects (which in English would correspond to the distinction between \"I\" and \"me\"). In English, the nominative case (e.g. \"I\") is used for the subject of all verbs, transitive or intransitive . Therefore, we use \"I\" for both \"I saw her\" and \"I slept\". The accusative case (e.g. \"me\") is reserved only for direct objects of transitive verbs (e.g. \"He loved me\" instead of \"He loved I\"). However, Ad\u00e8kora uses the Absolutive case (what \"would be\" the nominative) for the subject of intransitive verbs and direct objects , whereas the Ergative case is used only for subjects of transitive verbs . TODO add example. Dative Case \u00b6 The Dative Case acts very similarly to that of German . This case is used to mark the indirect object of a sentence; that is, the noun that receives (in some way) the direct object. TODO add example. Genitive Case \u00b6 The Genitive Case is used to mark that a noun is in some way a possesor of the clause immediately before. This is very similar to the English Saxon Genitive (the \" 's \" ending) used nowadays, but with reversed order. TODO add example. Locative Case \u00b6 The Locative Case is used to mark that a noun acts as a location for the sentence's action; this corresponds vaguely to the usage of English prepositions such as \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", etc. TODO add example. Proximals \u00b6 Proximals are an optional level of marking that can be applied to both nouns and pronouns to emphasize the proximity of the noun to the speaker or listener. The effect is very similar to what can be achieved by using adjectives like close , far in English, but instead ingrained in noun grammar. The three levels of proximity correspond to those used in Localizers , and are marked with a prefix for both noun articles and pronouns as follows: Proximal Marking in Noun Articles & Pronouns Unmarked Close Near Far Remote Far \u2205 ke- zhi- ake- Noun Declensions \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora morphologically declines Nouns (that are neither Pronouns nor Localizers ) in order to mark for Definiteness and Plurality ; all other aspects are taken care of by the use of a Noun Article . The declensions of Nouns have the following structure: {NOUN}-{DEFINITENESS}-{PLURALITY} Noun Definiteness Suffixes Animate Natural Artificial Abstract Geographical Definite \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 \u2205 Indefinite -zhu -xol -\u00f1ol -zhal -mol Noun Plurality Suffixes Singular \u2205 Plural -pal TODO add example. Noun Articles \u00b6 For nouns that are neither Pronouns nor Localizers , a mandatory article that comes before the noun is required. This article marks the noun in both Gender and Case . There is also an optional Proximal prefix. Noun articles have the following structure, marked as specified in the following paragraphs: {PROXIMAL}-{GENDER}-{CASE} Proximal Marking in Noun Articles Unnmarked Close Near Far Remote Far \u2205 ke- zhi- ake- Gender Marking in Noun Articles Animate Natural Artificial Abstract Geographical -dei- -du- -dem- -dar- -mi- Case Marking in Noun Articles Absolutive Ergative Dative Genitive Locative \u2205 -lo -cho -chem -chek This configuration allows 100 possible articles. However, given the agglutinative regularity of the affixes, the memorization required is much less than would be needed if there was no connection between the components. TODO add example. Pronouns \u00b6 The Pronouns of Ad\u00e8kora mark for Person , Number , Gender , Case , Definiteness and optionally Proximality . As opposed to nouns, pronouns do not carry a noun article , and present the following structure: {PROXIMAL}-{ROOT}-{PLURALITY}-{CASE} Proximal Marking in Pronouns Unmarked Close Near Far Remote Far \u2205 ke- zhi- ake- List of Pronoun Roots 1\u00b0 person 2\u00b0 person 3\u00b0 person Animate (formal) ixei zhiex zh\u00e0xe Animate (informal) ikei zhiek zh\u00e0ke Natural - uxem ux\u00e0 Artificial - \u00f1iem \u00f1\u00e0 Abstract - zharem zh\u00e0 Geographical - midem mid\u00e0 Pronoun Plurality Suffixes Singular \u2205 Plural -lem Case Marking in Pronouns Absolutive Ergative Dative Genitive Locative \u2205 -lo -cho -chem -chek In this structure, the Pronoun Root specifies the gender and number of the pronoun. Note that there is formality marking exclusively for the animate gender, and that first person pronouns are only defined for the animate gender. Ad\u00e8kora does not feature clusivity , and so the first person plural pronoun is ambiguous, as it can be exclusive or inclusive depending on context. TODO add example.

Tense \u00b6 The Tense of the verb situates the verb in time . Ad\u00e8kora has a simple tense system, having only Past, Present and Future. Tense agrees with the Gender of the subject (or with the Abstract Gender if the verb is avalent ), and is marked by the use of a suffix according to the following table. Verb Tense Suffixes Past Present Future Animate -zham \u2205 -zhen Natural -xam \u2205 -xen Artificial -\u00f1am \u2205 -\u00f1en Abstract -zam \u2205 -zen Geographical -mam \u2205 -men Past \u00b6 The Past Tense conveys that the action or state expressed by the verb belongs to the past. This includes single instances of actions that occured, the previous states of things, habits from the past, etc., which is specified by Aspect . Present \u00b6 The Present Tense conveys that the action or state expressed by the verb is occuring now in some fashion. This includes actions occuring now, current states, habits, etc., which is specified by Aspect . Future \u00b6 The Future Tense conveys that the action or state expressed by the verb has not yet occured and belongs to the future in some fashion. This includes actions expected to occur, predicted states, habits, etc., which is specified by Aspect . Aspect \u00b6 The Aspect of the verb gives information on how it extends over time , which helps present the action. Aspect is very related to Tense , and every combination of Tense-Aspect has a specific meaning. Aspect is marked by the use of a suffix according to the following table. Verb Aspect Suffixes Simple Continuous Perfect Perfect Continuous Affix -zhon \u2205 -pon -pai Gloss Abbr. SP CONT PFT PFT.CONT Simple \u00b6 The Simple Aspect is used to describe actions presented as a single point in time, with no particular highlight of the duration or the completion of the action. It very similar to the Perfective Aspect in linguistics. When used with the Past Tense , it describes actions that have happened in the past. When used with the Present Tense , it describes actions currently taking place. It can also be used to express orders in the Indicative Mood. When used with the Future Tense , it describes actions expected to occur in the future, usually highlighting said action's implicances over the present. TODO add examples. Continuous \u00b6 The Continuous Aspect is used to emphasize an action's duration over time, often to compare the action's span with other actions happening before, alongside or after. It is also used with stative verbs (those that indicate the state of something) and habits. It is very similar to the Imperfective Aspect in linguistics. When used with the Past Tense , it describes actions that have happened, with particular focus on the duration of the action, what happened during it, or what interrupted the event. (TODO add examples.) It is also used to talk about the state of things in the past, as well as habits from the past. When used with the Present Tense , it describes actions currently taking place, as well as the current state of things and habits. When used with the Future Tense , it describes actions expected to occur in the future, with particular focus on the expected duration of the action, what is expected to happen during the action, or what is expected to interrupt the event. It is also used to talk about the expected state of things in the future, as well as expected habits. Perfect \u00b6 The Perfect Aspect is used to emphasize the effects that an action's completion has over time. This Aspect cannot be used with the Present Tense in any Mood. When used with the Past Tense , it describes actions that have occured, with focus on how the past was affected after the action's completion. When used with the Future Tense , it describes actions that are expected to occur, with focus on how the future can be affected after the action's completion. Perfect Continuous \u00b6 The Perfect Continuous Aspect is a combination of both the Perfect and Continuous Aspects in that it is used to emphasize both the verb's completion and duration. This Aspect commonly focuses on what occured after the action or state terminated. This Aspect cannot be used with the Present Tense in any Mood. When used with the Past Tense , it describes actions that have occured and previous states, with focus on how the past was affected after the verb's completion. It also allows for greater comparisson with other events occuring alongside the verb than the Perfect Aspect. Whe used with the Future Tense , it describes actions and states that are expected to occur, with focus on how the future can be affected after the verb's completion. It also allows for greater comparisson with other events that are expected to occur alongside the verb than the Perfect Aspect. Mood \u00b6 The Mood of the verb expresses the attitude of the speaker towards the action or state expressed. This is useful for separating common speech intents such as wishes, orders, conditional phrases, etc. Mood is marked by the use of a prefix according to the following table. Verb Mood Prefixes Indicative Subjunctive Optative Interrogative Affix \u2205 chol- zhu- me\u00f1- Gloss Abbr. IND SJV OPT INT Indicative Mood \u00b6 The Indicative Mood is used to convey that the speaker considers that the verb expresses a real state of affairs (or will do so, when used with the Future Tense). This Mood also acts as an umbrella category for many other patterns of speech, such as orders, requests, exclamations, reasonings, etc. Its combination with the Tenses and Aspects has been covered in the Aspect subsections. Subjunctive Mood \u00b6 The Subjunctive Mood is used to express unreal scenarios as well as conditions and their hypothetical consequences. This Mood can only be used with the Simple and Continuous Aspects in all three Tenses. When used with the Past Tense , it conveys conditional scenarios in which a possible action or state in the past could have affected reality, as well as actions or states that may have occured in the past, arising from a hypothetical scenario. It is used with the Simple Aspect for actions and with the Continuous Aspect for stative verbs. When used with the Present Tense , it conveys conditional scenarios in which a possible action or state in the present could affect reality, as well as actions or states currently taking place, arising from a hypothetical scenario. It is used with the Simple Aspect for actions and with the Continuous Aspect for stative verbs. When used with the Future Tense , it conveys actions or states that may have occured in the future, arising from a hypothetical scenario. It is used with the Simple Aspect for actions and with the Continuous Aspect for stative verbs. TODO add explanation of conditionals and examples. Optative Mood \u00b6 The Optative Mood indicates wishes and desired states of affairs. This Mood can only be used with the Simple and Continuous Aspects in all three Tenses. When used with the Past Tense , it expresses a desire for the action or state to have ocurred in the past. It is used with the Simple Aspect for actions and with the Continuous Aspect for stative verbs. When used with the Present Tense , it expresses a desire for the action or state to be currently effective. It is used with the Simple Aspect for actions and with the Continuous Aspect for stative verbs. When used with the Future Tense , it expresses a desire for the action or state to occur sometime in the future. It is used with the Simple Aspect for actions and with the Continuous Aspect for stative verbs. Interrogative Mood \u00b6 The Interrogative Mood is used exclusively in interrogative clauses to indicate that the action or state conveyed by the verb is not actually stated, but is expressed as a request to the listener to confirm the veracity of the verb. Its combination with the Tenses and Aspects is very similar to that of the Indicative Case, but with the question-like meaning aggregated. This means that questions can give focus to the duration or completeness of the verb being asked, in order to place the interrogative clause in context with other actions at the time. TODO add example. Evidentiality \u00b6 The Evidentiality of the verb specifies the degree of certainty the speaker has about the action. Evidentiality is optional, and marked by the use of a suffix according to the following table. Verb Evidentiality Suffixes Affix Gloss Abbr. Usage Canonical -boi EV_CAN Commonly known to be true, obvious, etc. Participative -mei EV_PAR The speaker participated in the action Direct -knei EV_DIR The speaker sensed the action directly (e.g. saw, felt, heard, etc.) Trusted Reportative -er EV_TR_REP The speaker indirectly obtained information about the action via a reputable source Doubtful Reportative -kner EV_DF_REP The speaker indirectly obtained information about the action via a questionable source Trusted Logical -zhel EV_TR_LOG The speaker came to the conclusion that the action is real and is confident of its veracity Doubtful Logical -p\u0155zhel EV_DF_LOG The speaker speculates/guesses the action Rhetorical -d\u0155zhai EV_RT The speaker does not believe in the veracity of the action Evidentiality can only be marked when using the Indicative Mood . Verb Conjugation \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora morphologically conjugates Verbs in order to mark for Tense , Aspect , Mood and optionally level of evidence . Each of these categories has their respective list of affixes that do not morphologically interact with each other. The conjugations of Verbs have the following structure: {MOOD}-{VERB}-{TENSE}-{ASPECT}-{EVIDENTIALITY} Verb Mood Prefixes Indicative Subjunctive Optative Interrogative \u2205 chol- zhu- me\u00f1- Verb Tense Suffixes Past Present Future Animate -zham \u2205 -zhen Natural -xam \u2205 -xen Artificial -\u00f1am \u2205 -\u00f1en Abstract -zam \u2205 -zen Geographical -mam \u2205 -men Verb Aspect Suffixes Simple Continuous Perfect Perfect Continuous -zhon \u2205 -pon -pai Verb Evidentiality Suffixes Canonical Participative Direct Trusted Reportative -boi -mei -knei -er Doubtful Reportative Trusted Logical Doubtful Logical Rhetorical -kner -zhel -p\u0155zhel -d\u0155zhai Valency \u00b6 Like in many languages, each of Ad\u00e8kora's verbs has a valency associated, which counts the number of arguments that the verb needs to have in order to be grammatically correct. The following valency types are present in the language: Avalent verbs take no argument whatsoever, so there is no Subject nor Object in the sentence. TODO add example with \"rain\". Monovalent verbs (also called Intransitive verbs) take only one argument - the Subject - and no more. It is a common valency for stative verbs and some actions. TODO add example. Divalent verbs (also called Transitive verbs) take two arguments - the Subject and Direct Object - and no more or less. It is a common valency for many actions. TODO add example. Trivalent verbs (also called Bitransitive verbs) take three arguments - the Subject, the Direct Object and the Indirect Object. This valency is rather uncommon, reserved primarily for actions such as TODO add example give. Some verbs can also be Ambivalent , in the sense that they are gramatically correct with multiple valencies. TODO add example. The valency of a verb needs to be respected in order to convey a grammatically significant meaning. However, Ad\u00e8kora features common valency-changing operations that can help adapt the valency of verbs to simplify sentences. Passive Voice \u00b6 The passive voice is a common alteration of verbs that is also present in English. This operation transforms a transitive verb with Subject A and Direct Object P, and transforms the clause such that P becomes the subject S of a new clause. The original Subject A can be dropped, making the new clause intransitive . Every transitive verb can be passivized using the particle ka\u00f1 before the verb. TODO add example. Antipassive Voice \u00b6 The antipassive voice is an alteration of transitive verbs, which acts very similar to passive voice, except that instead of dropping the Subject A of the transitive clause, the Direct Object P is dropped instead, rendering a new intransitive clause that has Subject S as the original Subject A. This is used to emphasize the agent of the action, and is common when the object of the verb can be inferred from context. Every transitive verb can be antipassivized using the particle kam before the verb. TODO add example. Causative Voice \u00b6 The causative voice is an alteration which transforms intransitive clauses - with only a Subject S and no Object required - into a new transitive clause. This new clause now takes the original Subject S as the Object P, and the agent that causes the original subject to undergo the effects of the verb is promoted to the new required Subject A. Most intransitive verbs can be put in the causative voice using the particle mo before the verb. TODO add example. Valency Operation Combining \u00b6 It is possible to concatenate valency-changing operations in order to express a more precise meaning. When this occurs, the particles are applied from right to left in the order of the operations executed, and concatenated into a single word. TODO add example the soldier slept => she made-sleep the soldier => the soldier was made-sleep or => she made-sleep.

Questions \u00b6 By default, pitch tends to start somewhat high and slowly lower during a sentence. However, questions commonly have pitch suddenly increase at the final word of the sentence. Like in English, there are different pitch patterns to convey the type of question even when the underlying statement is the same. The most common question types used are the following: Yes/No Questions expect the answer to be either affirmative or negative. They start at a low pitch and gradually increase, reaching its highest at the end of the sentence. Alternative Questions provide a range of two or more expected answers. These answers are highlighted using a sudden high pitch. \"Wh\" Questions ask about aspects like the English \"Wh-\" words (What/Why/How/etc.). The particle that represent the corresponding \"Wh\" word in English is highlighted with a sudden high pitch. Unlike English, tone does not keep low after such word, and instead gradually goes up again very much like Yes/No Questions.

This is very similar to English, where \"I saw a man there\" changes meaning depending on which word the high pitch is placed on. Syllable Stress \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora features a fixed stress system , which means that there is a logical pattern used to select which syllable obtains primary stress, rather than an assigned stress for every particular word. To deduce the stress of any given word, the concept of strong syllables is used. We categorize as a strong syllable any syllable that meets any of the following conditions: Its vowel component is either \u00e0 or \u00e8 Its onset component is three consonants long, as specified by the possible clusters of Syllable Clustering Its coda component is geminated, as specified by the rules of Consonant Repetition With that definition, the process to obtain its stress is the following: If the word contains any strong syllables , primary stress corresponds to the leftmost strong syllable. Secondary stress is applied to all other strong syllables. If the word does not contain any strong syllable , divide the syllables into Feet . To do this, start making groups of two syllables, starting from the left. (For example, bu-ke-dem would be divided like (bu-ke)-dem ; one Foot and a solitary syllable). Primary stress corresponds to the left syllable of the rightmost Foot. If there are other complete Feet, the left syllable of each receives secondary stress. Here are some examples of stress for various words; Feet are marked using parentheses, and strong syllables are marked in bold . Primary and secondary stress are marked using ' and , respectively.

This means that all syllables have: From zero to three consonants as the onset Exactly one vowel (in the form of a monophthong or diphthong) as the nucleus Zero or one consonant as the coda Syllable Clustering \u00b6 Onset Clustering \u00b6 When the onset has a single consonant, all 14 consonants can be used. When the onset has two consonants, only the following combinations are allowed: pn p\u0155 pr pzh pl b\u0155 br bzh d\u0155 dr dz kn k\u0155 kr kz kzh zhm zhn zh\u00f1 When the onset has three consonants, only the following combinations are allowed: p\u0155zh b\u0155zh d\u0155zh k\u0155zh If the coda of the previous syllable is zh and the onset of the next syllable also starts with zh (as in zhm , zhn or zh\u00f1 ), gemination is used as discussed in Consonant Repetition . (For example, xazh-zhme-ra is adjusted to xazh-me-ra / xa\u0292\u02d0me.\u027ea /). Nucleus Clustering \u00b6 Any single one of the 13 vowels (counting monophthongs and diphthongs) can be used as the nucleus. Coda Clustering \u00b6 Any single one of the 14 consonants can be used as the coda. However, certain rules apply: If the nucleus ends with a closed monophthong (i.e. i , u , \u00e0 , \u00e8 ), then the coda must be empty. (For example, d\u00e8 is valid, whereas d\u00e8m is not.) Plosives (i.e. p , b , d , ch , k ) can only appear in codas of the last syllables of words. (For example, kap and lamkap are both valid, while lapkap is invalid.) Consonant Repetition \u00b6 In general, if the same phoneme appears next to itself as both a coda and an onset, it is geminated such that a single geminated sound remains, acting as an ambisyllabic phoneme. For example, kil-le\u00f1 would be converted to kile\u00f1 ( /kil\u02d0e\u0272/ ), which can be separated into syllables as both kil-e\u00f1 and ki-le\u00f1 (though the former is more commonly used). The gemination is also used to cover cases where \u0155 and r appear next to each other. In such situations, a geminated \u0155 remains. For example, kar-\u0155ox would convert to ka\u0155ox . Syllable Separation \u00b6 Syllable separation is not used to convey semantical difference. For example, there can only be one word that is pronounced as kaxan , and it may be separated into syllables as kax-an or ka-xan . Alhtough the default is for the shared consonant to fall in the onset (like in ka-xan ), the rules of syllable separation can have exceptions (especially when applying many affixes to the same word), which is why the separation is explicited using notation.

The topics are ordered with the intention of putting the simpler and more neccesary concepts first, and then going into finer details. More examples and exceptions are listed in the respective sub-pages. Examples are written using the romanization system . Word Order \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora follows SVO Word Order , which means that sentences usually have the Subject, then the Verb and lastly the Objejct. This is the same as English, so a sentence such as \"The cat follows her\" would have the words for cat (< kolexa >), follow (< plau >) and her (< ilzh\u00e0xelem >) in that same order. Head-Directionality \u00b6 Ad\u00e8kora is a strongly head-initial language. This means that in many types of phrases, the most important component - the head - is usually placed at the start. This applies to the following structures: Noun-Adjective order : in noun phrases where adjectives affect a noun , the noun is placed first and the adjectives follow. Verb-Adverb order : in verb phrases where adverbs affect a verb , the verb is placed first and the adverbs follow. Adjective-Adverb order : in cases where an adverb is modifying an adjective, the adjective is placed first with any modifiers following afterwards. Noun-Genitive order : genitive clauses - those that express possesion - place the noun first and the genitive afterwards. Preposition-Noun order : Ad\u00e8kora mainly uses adpositions that come before clauses - especially noun phrases - to convey various aspects such as relative position, temporal relation, etc. Noun-Relative Clause order : noun phrases that use relative clauses to further describe the subject typically place the noun first and the relative clause afterwards. Negation \u00b6 Negation is expressed by the use of the two negation particles lau and kun . The particle lau is placed just before the start of the clause being negated (usually a verb phrase), while kun is located at the end of the clause. This effectively encapsulates the clause. TODO add example \"I do not like cats\" => \"I LAU like cats KUN\" For common phrases in which there is no ambiguity of the clause that is negated, the particle before the clause can be omitted, and the particle placed at the end can be either one of the two particles. This is common in informal speech. TODO add example \"I do not see her\" => \"I see her KUN\" \"I am not sleeping\" => \"I sleeping KUN\" or \"I sleeping LAU\" The usage of both particles is especially useful in sentences where there are multiple elements being negated, in order to disambiguate.

This means that instead of having the digits from 0 to 9 like in many languages, only the digits corresponding from 0 to 7 are present. Whereas number eight would be < 8 > in English, Ad\u00e8kora represents this as the digit for one followed by the digit for zero (literally, < 10 >). The digits for zero to three are unique. After those, the remaining four digits modify the previous ones by adding a horizontal stroke which represents an addition of four units (e.g. two is < 2 >; adding the stroke six is obtained, < 6 > ). Negative Numbers \u00b6 Negative integers can be represented by suffixing the digits with the syllable TODO_WRITING_SYSTEM_NEGATIVE (literally negative ). Therefore, negative fifteen (< -15 >) would be represented as < 17'nex >. Fractional Numbers \u00b6 Numbers with a decimal point can be represented by using the syllabic separator mark ( suka\u00f1ela , < ' >) very similarly to the decimal point in common mathematical notation.
